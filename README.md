# What are Minimal APIs?
Minimal APIs are a lightweight and simplified approach to building web APIs in .NET. They allow developers to create focused APIs with less code and configuration, making them easier to set up and maintain. This approach is well-suited for microservices and serverless architectures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why Minimal APIs?
Traditional ASP.NET Core applications, especially those built with MVC, come with a considerable amount of boilerplate code. For scenarios where simplicity and brevity are paramount, Minimal APIs provide a cleaner and more concise alternative.
    1- Minimal code for API
    2- Simple and straightforward
    3- More efficient than API
    4- More features are being added
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When to Use Minimal APIs?
Minimal APIs are well-suited for small to medium-sized projects, microservices, or scenarios where a lightweight and focused API is sufficient. They shine in cases where rapid development and minimal ceremony are top priorities.
